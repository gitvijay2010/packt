Packt assessment

------------

I have used an bootstrap template and listed down the products in homepage.

APIs used: Products List, Product Pricing and Cover Image.

Open config/app and update 'packt_key' variable for the API secret key.

No tables are used since all data's are available via API so no migration is required.

Run composer install.

Run php artisan serve, you are done.

Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000 or what's displayed in the window.
